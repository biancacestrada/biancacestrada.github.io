      <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
      <p>My name is Bianca Estrada and I am a multimedia artist. I am currently located in the San Jose area, originally from SoCal. I am a student at San Jose State University, class of 2020. I am majoring in Preparation for Teaching, with a focus on 3D sculpture. After graduation I plan on staying at SJSU for my teaching credential and hopefully my masters.</p>

    <p>I have a passion for teaching and believe that there is an artist in anyone. I have a great deal of patience working to master new media and can pick up things rather fast, which I can then teach in a simpler way. My career goal is to teach at a public school and touch the lives of struggling students looking to find their passion. </p> 
    <p> I have been practicing art for the short time of 5 years, however I have experience with many different forms of media. Some of them being, welding, printmaking, paper mache, painting, drawing, ceramics, digital, wire work, and many more. I have more of a focus on the 3D form, particularly with ceramics. My style is beautiful and dark with many hidden personal messages within my work. I tend to keep the detail in the sculpture itself and leave the colors monotone and dark. My work tends to voice the struggle of mental illness and the necessity to embrace the darkness and the beauty it could possibly create.</p>
